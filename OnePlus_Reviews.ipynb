       " \"After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.\\n\",\n",

I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good. There is no lagging issue till now. The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first. Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit. Speakers are loud and produce decent sound.

It's mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box.This is like misleading the customers by giving false information.Secondly, I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS.Having said that, I'm facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It's on and off but it still bothers me. Didn't expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so, when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2.Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage.I don't like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But, when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera.

       " \"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I'm an iPhone user for last few years!! So I had a feeling any Android device cannot beat the camera, display and user interface experience of iphone. But here it is, OnePlus 7T with 90hz display is just a magic in hand. And also the camera is just superb.Initially I wanted to go for iPhone 11, buy instead decided to go for this and I feel I made a right decision. So close to eyes and go for this, you'll love it\\n\",\n",

       " \"Was sceptical when watched reviews that it gives OnePlus 7pro a run for it's money. But having using since last 4days. I am assured that it does give OnePlus 7pro, Samsung S10 and even Iphone 11 a run for the money.Interface- I used MIUI, EMIUI, amigo os, but none of those were never smooth as Oxygen OS. It's super fluid and killing fast (credit also goes to SD855+ and 8gb ram).Camera- One of the best under 50k that's the only thing I can say.Built Quality- On par with other premium smartphonesDisplay- Have used LCD panel display phones for entire life. So yes, really enjoying watching videos. (And to make the things more sweeter Stereo Speakers on the phone)Verdict- If you can spend 3-4k more than OnePlus 7. Then do it. It will be worth it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"Got my phone yesterday, it's just amazing 😍Pros: Camera is amazing, it is super fast and look is splendid.Cons: heats up a bit while charging and drains quite fast.Great phone overall.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nice phone...Camera superb, Battery great and ideal premium phone at such an affordable price\\n',\n",
       " \"Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Hands down. It's a beast. Flagship killer anyday.Lucky enough to buy one of these at mid budget price.Battery performance is not that great but for the 90hz display I think it does just fine. And anyway your getting the 30w fast charger.Customisations in oxygen OS are cool and hardware feels premiumStock android experience which I always love.Scary part is the glass back. Feels slippery and online videos show its tendency to break on impact. For now, iam using the case which comes in the box and its decent.I see forums complaining about the ugly camera but in real it doesn't look that ugly at all. Camera does the job perfectly in all modes. You don't need the iPhone 11 pro unless your a professional photographer and care about detailing.Overall I would give this phone a 9/10 and a major go.Buying this will not put a hole in your pocket and gives you the value of each penny spent. OnePlus phones can be easily used for 3-4 years and maybe even more since the company sends in updates regularly.Hope this review is useful.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I was using Samsung phone and with all the talk going around thought of giving one plus a try.  Received oneplus7t and set up the phone.  Not worth of spending.

       " \"Ladies and GentlemanPutting up this review after 1 week of rigorous use of the OnePlus 7T .Firstly, if you have the money and you want to invest in a decent flagship phone and tired of the vivos and MIs of the world...then your search ends here!Presenting 1+7t, the flagship premium phone presented to us by 1+Firstly to start off you are going to love the display...the 90Hz refresh is one beauty of a feature. Powered with sAMOLED display, this phone doesn't leave any stones unturned.It has a nice powereful 8gb RAM that does justice to the phone. In short its an iOS version of AndroidWrap30t powerful charging powers your phone to 70% in less than 30 mins and 100% in less than  an hour. The charger is a bit bulky. But you are not going to carrry it all time with ur phone ;). the battery runs for about a day with mediun to high usage.Storage- if youare a heavy user with a lot of gaming and media content, go for the 256gb version. Else 128gb should do the job well.Enhanced features like Digital wellbeing, Zen mode helps u to measure ur screen time and achieve a good mobile-life balanceOxygenOS is smooth and this vomes with a perloaded  Oxygen10 OS out of the box.Dolby Atmos surround sound works like a masterpiece. You wont need the full volume most of the times..Pls note- this phone does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. You got to buy a good decent type C to Aux converter OR simply just buy a good Bluetooth headset.The camera is lovely. Pictures are just perfect with the right color balance. Doesn't whitewash ur pix like the mid range phones. It can put up a good show against the latest iPhone variants.The finger print sensor is decent and does its job.The packaging is premium. It is a big box, All RED, with an invite letter, charger, back cover, some stickers.The phone comes with a preloaded glass protector and a premium case with all the cuts at the right places .Betwen 1+7 and 7t, if you are running low on budget and willing to compromise on the Triple camera setup, 30t charging, 90Hz display...Go for the base 1+7 variant.Between 1+7t and pro, go for 7t guys...as this is packed with a much advanced hardware.Guys also look for the 1+7t series launch on Oct 19 before evaluating.Hope you all enjoyed the review.

       " \"Editing after 3 weeks of usage of the replacement. Apart from the camera design, the phone proves to be a wonderful package. Asusual a 5 star performer from Oneplus.Delivery took a week's time. After the long wait was eager to check the triple camera setup. When i took pics in wide the too right quarter of the image was too much hazy. First i thought it was some dust in front of the cam. After a close examination could find a dent or scratch over the wide angle lens. This was causing a hazy picture. When i tried to replace the phone with amazon, they are not right away doing it and said there will be a technician at my door step in 3 days time to check on the issue. Based on his report the phone may be replaced. This is not fair, already i waited a week to get the phone and again i won't be able to use it for another week 😣.I have been an oneplus admirer right from oneplus one and this have never happened with oneplus. My request to oneplus to tighten up the quality check before packing the priduct.A minute dent is making me wait almost 20 days to use your oneplus7t.Rest of the 2 cameras are super good. Macro is extraordinary and night scape has improved a lot.And focusing on my issue im uploading few pics. Check the top right corner for the haziness.Amazon please arrange the replacement as soon as possible. I may change my rating to 5 star once i get the good replacement.\\n\",\n",

Gorilla Glass at screen is good enough to handle little drops. Back glass can be fragile. Use this phone with a case and take it out of it sometime to praise it\\'s look.Performance - No words.Camera - A lot of playful modes that you can try, shooting macro shots is great, video stabilization is good, 960 fps slow motion is also coming to this phone. Photos turns out great, but Colors are not natural. Hope they can fix it with updates.Speakers - Loud and clear.Network Connectivity - Cellular reception is very good, WiFi strength is also good. I am able to use WiFi where my previous phone struggled.Haptic feedback - OnePlus claims they have improved haptic feedback on this phone. They might have done it, but there are better phones out there with better vibration. From my experience, vibrations on this phone is thin but instant.Charging - Warp 30T is very fast. Charges to 100% in about an hour. Some people here are confused regarding the charging brick because they were expecting WARP 30T branding on the included charger. The internal circuitry inside this phone makes charging even faster, the \"T\" is inside your phone not on the brick, that\\'s why included charger is WARP 30 and not WARP 30T.Oxygen OS - Smooth.

Leave all aside, just look at the price at which all these specs are being offered, and yiu would not complain. Oxygen OS has just become my favorite skin on top of android and it's simply amazing. The customisation, the optimisation, speed at which apps open , memory management and I could just go on, but it's just brilliant.If I have to yet nitpick, I'd say the camera is just fine, the screen finger print reader is okaish and that's all.Undoubtedly it's a great phone and even better after the arrival of the 7t pro, getting all the specs the higher model packs into a lower priced model is simoly awesome. I'd anyday prefer the 7t over the pro model. But that's just personal preference.\\n\",\n",

Camera is absolutely amazing ,crisp quality top notch performance low light to outdoor perfect scenarios the camera performes as expected and crazy as hell.even the 4k video with 60fps is stunning . Front can is quite good with nice color contrast and white balance gets u wonderful indor and outdoor selfies .6.gaming beast .pubg, cod , fortnite runs extremely smooth with 90hz display the games are amazing.7.battery is good as it lasted me a day with 20% remaining that to playing games for 10 to 20 min with gps and mobile data on for the most of the time .avg on screen time 6hr 20 min to 7hr (if not playing games and gps turned off ...u get better time).8.WARP charge is beast .In 20min the phone charged from 8% to 84% which is silly fast and crazy as hell .

One plus doesn't provide the extended type c to 3 .5 mm jack which is disappointing, but in the world of Bluetooth this can be adjusted.2.NO LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT this is personal choice and I prefer to have notification light which indicates any notifications and charge indication..3.no memory slot which is kind of ok with me but still who doesn't want extra storage 😉Verdict: premium phone with flagship features and BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK .

The display also gets plenty bright tooThe cemras do need some more work which and sure will be fixed over software updates in the days to come. I do Miss the headphone jack but we also miss days where global warming was not a thing!!Battery is not as good as the other OnePlus phones all cause the display is a power hungry Led, thanks to the 90hz refresh rate. Drop it to 60hz and voila your good to go!! But then if you would do that, there is no sense in buying this phone in the first place. And also you have Dash Charge 30T.

       " \"Ok so I am using this device from 3 days. Here is my review. I bought this phone after using iPhone 7 plus and Vivo NEX. Everyone here is writing about pros. But I will write about cons.1. UI - there are too many issues with software. For example it has gesture navigation option. But trust me. Its use less. You will be back to old school navigation key after few hours. Every one use mobile case these days. And it is very hard to use those gestures with case on. Also it conflicts with many apps. You will not be able to open menu of any app due to these gestures. Vivo nex has this feature but they implemented it very well.2. Battery - It has only 3800mAh battery. You may have watched many videos it is enough for 5-6 hours. Trust me it's not. I am getting only 4- hours SOT with very normal uses. Update - I lost 2% battery while writing this review.3. Charging - Oneplus says it support 30W charger. So let me come to reality. I Compared this phone with my old vivo nex. And I found 7t charges at maximum 3450mA (checked with Ampare app). And Vivo nex with has 23.5W charger charges at 4100mA. Don't know why any YouTube didn't mentioned it.4. Camera - The thing I liked about camera is just macro mode. Every thing else is still below average in this price range. Front camera and portrait mode is even worse than my 3 year old iPhone 7 plus.Fingerprint, facescanner and performance is perfect.\\n\",\n",

       " \"The brand has delivered once again. I have been using the OnePlus 7 before this. But the 7T is not just an incremental upgrade. It has much more to it. Let's start with a few key differences between the OnePlus 7 and 7T1) The vibration motor has now haptic feedback. Much better than linear motor on op 7 and almost similar to OP7 Pro. I love it.2) The phone is slimmer and has a better feel in hand though bigger but has a more sharp corners which adds decency in contrast to rounded corners on OP7. Also notch size is reduced.3) the cameras. Well everyone knows about the cameras. I would like to say that the macro lens that uses the ultrawide lens, is not just a gimmick. It can take photos of fabrics that even the eyes cannot see.4) the smoothness of 90hz screen is just really good to experience.5) The antutu benchmark score. 400000 in comparison to 370000 of oneplus.6) the dual speakers. The ear piece speaker has now higher volume than bottom speaker. On the 7 it was opposite. Also 7t's sound is slightly richer than 7.7) Well the warp charge 30T really adds up. It charges the phone from 0 to 67 in 30 mins. And 0 to 100 in 61 mins. Saves a lot of time. Whereas the 7 takes 86 mins.8) it comes pre installed with Android 10. So 2 Android updates are guaranteed. Whereas 7 came with Pie. Most likely to get an update less.Well now the cons:1)I got a little defective piece. The screen adhesive was slightly visible on left hand side. So opted for a replacement.2)  The wifi sometimes disconnects and thrn reconnects on its own. Maybe a software issue. OnePlus might fix it soon.Well got it for 36k from Amazon. A must buy phone. Cannot keep myself from recommending. Kudos to OnePlus.\\n\",\n",

The phone didn't have any damage, but I believe am the one who got a rare faulty item. Reached out to amazon over phone, had to wait in queue for like 20 mins, then customer care rep understood the issue and scheduled a Service Visit to check the issue, post which if he determines its a faulty unit I might get a replacement new phone. Will update review and rating post that.Update 10-10-2019:After a lot of struggle and blockages, finally got it replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Nitu from Amazon who helped me out.

Probably not up to latest iPhone & pixel levels but it’s only a whisker away from them.4. Design & looks.

No 3.5mm Headphone jack. No headphone included with the phone.2. Battery back not as good as op7, mostly due to bigger & faster refresh rate screen. However battery back is more than average. This con is basically nitpicking.The hardware & software this device offers for the price it is asking for, is almost unbelievable. Price to perform ratio of this phone is probably the best in the market right now. For me it is.

(But you'll get bored of the smoothness within a day, wanting for features more useful, more evident, more everyday).2. Fast charging is fast enough. Thank you for giving it in the box.3. Plus point for the design. Camera design is great compared to the square fiasco by other phones. Back is awesome, both the Colors. Looks very premium. (But surely you'll keep a case, hiding the greatness of the back).3. Oxygen OS is great compared to most other customised OS. Fast and smooth.4. Phone performs without any lag whatsoever with heaviest of usage. (Battery optimisation is not that smart, apps reload quite a bit after minimising and reopening them. Real time messages are sometimes not shown till we open the app say WhatsApp.)5. Great box (no utility though, only the feeling.)6. Cover supplied with the phone may not be beautiful, but is strong enough and has proper cuts.7. Battery is good. (But with 90hz display and possibly heavy usage - obviously, hence bought the phone with 855+ - the battery drains quite quickly. 3800 is less compared to the average in budget phones.) But anyway, it covers the whole day and fast charging in the box is a good move.8. Love the side slider for sound.Cons:1. 3.5mm to C converter not provided. (Should've given that instead of the cover, as cover is a personal choice but the converter is useful to all)2. SIM tray design is very bad. (My SIM tray got stuck on the very first day, will have to go to the service centre, god knows how much they'll charge.) SIM tray should have a lock system which holds the cards intact to avoid such problems. (Network is working fine, just the tray won't come out, so I can't change sim card now. Really disappointed with this issue on the very first day.)3. Camera performance, battery performance, and sound quality is good, but expected more at this price point. (Though fast charger, number of camera types, and stereo speakers are the plus points.)4. Heavy and fat phone, if you previously used slim and light phones.5. Android system utilizes almost 28GB of storage. (64 GB version is not present for a good reason.)6. Somehow, not that satisfied or happy after getting the new phone. It's a great phone, but still I feel a bit overcharged due to the cons faced.I believe, all utilities should be provided out of the box, for example 3.5 mm converter, or c-type earphones, or wireless earphones, fast charger, lens cleaner and glass cleaner, etc. And all personalization accessories like covers, screen guards, lens guards, stickers, etc can be purchased by users themselves. This increases the overall utility of the box bundle.Here I'm purchasing an already expensive phone and then paying several more for some really necessary accessories.\\n\",\n",

       " \"This is my first OnePlus device. My cousins have been using OnePlus phones (OnePlus 3 and 5T) since a long time. I was previously using the Redmi Note 4 so the jump to OnePlus was quite a big one for me. From using an entry level phone to buying a Flagship, it was a giant leap. Got great discount on this phone (₹3600 off for exchanging Redmi Note 4 and ₹1700 off on ICICI card). I got the phone on 16th of October and have been using the phone ever since. I'll divide my review between the pros and consPROS:-1. BATTERY LIFE. It may seem weird but somehow because of OnePlus's optimizations, I'm getting a SOT of around 6.5-7 hours. If you really try to kill the battery, then also you'd get a SOT of atleast 5 hours2. PERFORMANCE. This phone absolutely flies. The SD855+ processor is a multitasking beast. No stuttering or lags whatsoever3. RAM MANAGEMENT. The RAM management on this phone is insanely good. Apps never get refreshed. Just don't enable the RAM Boost option in settings4. CAMERA. The cameras on this phone are great. Daytime photos look good with slightly increased contrast. The nightscape mode is just too good. Better than Pixels in my opinion. The Super Stable Video mode is a godsend5. SOUND QUALITY. The stereo speakers on this phone are extremely loud and clear. Dolby Atmos really works6. HAPTICS. The vibration motor on this phone is really awesome. Crisp and Precise7. CHARGING. This phone charges at a crazy fast rate. I get 0-71% in half an hour and 0-100% in 55 minutes8. DISPLAY. That 90hz refresh rate is silky smooth. You won't go back to 60hz again. Every other phone with 60hz refresh rate (iPhone, Note 10+, Pixel 3 XL, Mate 30 Pro etc) feels laggy after using this phone.CONS:-1. SYSTEM STABILITY. There are a few bugs here. The brightness wouldn't go to full even after you have set it to max. It'll take 1-2 seconds extra to go to full brightness. Sometimes, Chrome freezes on its own.2. NO USB-C TO 3.5MM DONGLE IN BOX3. NO EARPHONES IN BOXMISCELLANEOUS:-1. The screen flickers at low brightness. Not a hardware issue. It's the nature of OLED displays. You can't see it with your naked eyes but a camera can pick it up. If it bothers you, enable the DC Dimming feature2. AMOLED displays have a hard time displaying correct images on a dark grey background under low brightness. So no need to panic if you see some reddish or greenish tint on a grey backgroundOverall, This is an awesome phone. No phone is perfect. Each phone has a few bugs. I have already got 2 software updates regarding system stability and camera quality. OnePlus is known to remove all bugs from their phones through software updates so no need to worry if you find some bugs.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",

Didnt want to carry DSLR for my travels hence landed up at this. I am fully satisfied.Fingerprint sensor - Bit slow but pretty much acceptable. This doesn't mark phone in negative side.Battery - It ran for more than a day for me. I clicked around 50 pics, saw 10 videos, did setup of numerous app in this phone after one time charge and still it ran for more than a day. So, i am happy with that.90/60 htz - I shifted to 60 hts and performance was good enough.Charging - Fastest ever seen.App opening time - Very fast, impressive.Memory- I can see 256 total available memory. So its not like other phones which shows 223 available out of 256 GB.Sound - Excellent. Enjoyed playing videos on YT and Savn app.Earphone Jack - Bought a type C converter from local market(Pimpri,Pune) for INR 80 and it did the job well.Body Cover - It looks like a normal cover. Doesn't hold mobile tightly. I would change that to a better one soon. I see some good covers are launching on 20th October for INR 599. They looks superb and rigid.\\n\",\n",

It took me around 58 mins to charge the phone from 0-100 which is definitely the best in the market.Call quality and signal reception is good even when there is no proper signal reception on my brothers k20 pro.Face unlock is faster and the fingerprint reader is also improved.Oxygen 0s!!!!!! Belive me, If u switch to oxygen os,then clearly u will never back off .For a regular user who does gaming very often, the performance is top notch, the snapdragon 855 plus can handle anything at ease.Overall one plus has offered a complete packageFinally,I have no regrets in buying this phone over the rog phone 2........\\n\",\n",
       " 'This is my very first OnePlus device and I\\'m loving it so far. First of all the delivery by Amazon was real quick so a big thank you to Amazon for that. I received it on 4th Oct, 19 and have used it for 18 days. I wanted to wait for a few days before I wrote a review. Now coming to the device, starting off with the camera since I brought it for the camera honestly. It is pretty decent and super fast. By fast I mean even if the subject moves instantly 99% of the time you will have a good shot. The picture quality is great, the portrait shots look almost as if taken from a DSLR camera and with a little bit of editing they look stunningly beautiful.(I have provided two non- edited shots which I think look great) The micro mode takes some time to focus at night I don\\'t know why and even in daylight sometimes it has problem focussing but that can be manually handled. The wide angle camera is equally good but I mostly use the portrait mode.Also, I think the camera takes up the natural colours pretty well. I love to edit pictures but with this device I almost have stopped editing as much since the natural pictures from the normal camera only turn out to be great and I love how natural the colours look.I\\'d say the stability of the videos is nice too not too great as iPhone of course but it\\'s decent as well. The video quality is okayish. The front camera is okayish. I didn\\'t find both of them to be that great.The 90hz refresh rate definitely makes the experience smoother but if u ask me personally I don\\'t find it to be the biggest pro because 60hz is fine for me as well. So I don\\'t see a much of a drastic difference there.( It is also because I don\\'t play games) What I love more apart from the camera is the Dolby Atmos sound, I am a music person and listening to music in this just gives another kind of a satisfaction. You can feel the detail in the sound. (I bet all the music lovers can agree here 😆). I love the brightness adjustment and the night mode. It is really helpful for a person like me who uses the phone most at night (my eyes thank OnePlus every night! 😆)  The fingerprint reader is love love love. Fast af. After using it I don\\'t even want to use face unlock. Now what I don\\'t like about the phone, The battery is a big No- No. When u r buying a phone worth rs.38k you\\'d expect an awesome battery life.  The battery is below average. Despite the warp charging being super fast, I don\\'t like the fact that it drains at this rate. If u r ever stuck at a jungle would u need fast charging or a better capacity battery? 😄 I\\'d like the later. I really wanted a phone that I won\\'t have to charge much. The 13k Samsung M30s has a better battery than this tbh. It lasts 2 days without charging. (I know it has a bigger battery of 6000 mAh) So OnePlus improve the battery life instead of decreasing the charging time. Also, I have heard fast charging detoriates li-ion batteries faster than normal charging. So the more you fast charge, the more the device heats, the quicker your battery will detoriate. Also, there\\'s a hypothesis that states that charging the battery from 20-80% is the best. Now u tell me am I buying a 38k phone to think and get tensed about how much should I charge? I charge it to a 100% everyday. I don\\'t follow any rules because I can\\'t I need the device throughout the day and seeing its battery drainage doesn\\'t help, so 80% is not my call. In short the battery sucks when compared with the price u pay. 😁 And how can I forget this devices heats, it really does and it is not even summers rn. And I don\\'t even play games in it, just with continuous browsing too it heats which is something that I hate about phones. But since it\\'s a device with usage it is okay for it to heat a little. What\\'s more problematic is its heating while charging even in a cold room. And that\\'s bad for the battery.(I\\'ll update more about the heating issue in summers). Someone once wrote in an OnePlus 7 review that u can basically fry an omelet on the phone I hope I don\\'t end up frying them too! 😂 Network connectivity is good. Calling quality good (till now). I hate the fact that it doesn\\'t have a headphone jack and that\\'s a bummer! Also, the type- c charging port doesn\\'t seem durable to me! And if u use earphones in them too I don\\'t know how long it will last! The phone\\'s built quality is okayish, the back can easily break at one fall, the camera bump being this big can get destroyed at one fall. So it\\'s a ticking timebomb for 38k. 😂 Because someday we r gonna drop it, drop it real good. And OnePlus what\\'s with the ugly AF cover man! At least provide us with a good durable back cover instead of that see through ugly one. And include at least cheap quality earphones in the box. I\\'ve tried to review it extremely honestly, there\\'s no lie in here. If u have survived it till here thank u for reading. I think it\\'s a great device for it\\'s price range despite the cons being more than the pros. I\\'d recommend u to buy it if camera and performance is your priority and battery is not. I\\'d update it after one year of usage. Also, a quick note to all those people writing \"dhokha hua hai dhokha\" chota box Mila hai bara nahi, bhaiyon aur behno wo \"Reviewer\\'s box hai\" Jo sirf YouTubers ko milta hai review Karne ke lie! Wo tumhe kabhi nahi milega! So stop giving bad reviews for a dhoka Jo kabhi hua hi nahi hai! 😅😂 Thank you! Happy Buying! 😄\\n',\n",
       " 'Well I am using OnePlus since OnePlus 5 launch.Not an adequate phone. Battery life is not good like other OnePlus phones. Even OnePlus 5t is giving better battery life. Camera is good.

       " \"Received my phone 12hrs ago..... Here's my initial impressions. (Was in a dilemma between this and the ROG2... But since I don't game at all and the styling was a bit too loud for my taste, I went ahead with this classic beauty, I spite of the battery life and other obvious advantages).PROs1) Awesome built quality... I like the in hand feel of the phone and it's possible (not comfortable though) to use it with one hand, if ur hands r big enough.2) Screen is amongst the best I've seen and used, (used a super amoled on Samsung previously). There's a screen guard pre installed and I didn't feel the need to remove it as it didn't hinder my fingerprint or input via the touchscreen.3) Software is a total gem.... It's clean and with no bloatware whatsoever.4) I personally like the alert slider... Its quite handy for me.5) Performance is buttery smooth and RAM management has been done well. The apps stay in memory all the time.(I tried with 7 apps open at the same time). Since I don't play games of any sort, I didn't test it out.6) Speakers are good...its loud enough and clear at the same time.7) Camera is a mixed bag. It's good enough for social media and with a lil bit of editing, u can take some real good pics but don't expect top tier level quality. So maybe photo buffs should consider a different phone with a great camera.8) Charging speed is a beast... Nothing else comes close.CONS1) lack of a headphone jack is a real bummer for me... Especially since my Bluetooth headset (Sony Mdr-xb650BT) doesn't seem to connect no matter what I try.2) The gestures are a hit and miss at the moment, maybe it'll improve with time but so far am not enjoying it. And the software buttons, while typing messages u accidentally type the home button which leads to the home screen and makes the typing experience really annoying. So sticking with gestures in this one.3) Battery life could be a problem. I was using it in the 90hz mode when I received it and within 1 Hr battery dropped by over 16%...... So, 90hz is cool and all but I've reverted back to 60hz refresh rate to see by how much the battery performance improves. Will test it more in the following days and decide based on the result.So those are my very early initial impressions. Maybe I'll update after couple of weeks time for a more detailed review.Enjoy the device👍\\n\",\n",
       " \"So After research on youtube for last couple of months to upgrade my OP3T ended up buying oneplus 7T . Its been 48 hours with the phone and i feel the phone is not VFM. The reason lies with the other excellent phones under 25K which can provide 90% of this performance. Beyond 25K, law of diminishing returns kicks in. If you still decide to spend 40K for an android phone and ok with mediocre camera you can buy this eyes closed. The details of my observations are as below.Ergonomics and Build qualityThe phone is Huge.This is not deal breaker as we get used to this eventually. The build quality is good though we can see most of the phones beyond 15K started having decent build quality.So no points to OP since we are paying premium for this.The camera setup may not look great, but who cares since it is on the back of the phone. The pre applied screen protector doesn't server any purpose except that we don't need to buy the screen protector/tempered glass immediately. It buys you some days. It doesn't matter if its blue or silver as we all cover them up in cases or skins.DISPLAYThe Screen quality is good(Read Not Excellent) and AMOLED colours are accurate except for the Whites. The whites are not accurate like in any other AMOLED panel. Dark mode is the savior though.Wonder why phones these days are trying to look like shilpa shetty,tall and slim. I am 16:9 guy so didn't like this 20:9 aspect ratio.The 90HZ panel is excellent however there are very less games which could use this. For ex the famous PUBG can give 60FPS at max. The phone creates the perspective of super snappiness because of this 90HZ. Combining this panel with SD855+ makes this phone an excellent performer. The phone does support HDR on netflix ,however i did not find any breathtaking difference with that in the video qualityCAMERA There is nothing great to talk about this camera quality, Average at best.THe photos doesn look detailed, Sharp. We cant choose the resolution and cant take 48MP photo. I know MP is not everything but this helps to crop and take good prints. The wide angle and telephoto lens addition is a good thing,attracts the people who beleive in Specs but not in actual performance. The photos from these phone are a slight improvement from my OP3T which is not so positive thing considering 24K K20 pro provides similar or slightly better photos. Google Cam is not that stable so we have to wait for updates from oneplus.The MACRO mode is also a good addition which we might use it in initial days and  eventually forgot that this even existsSoftwareThis is where Oneplus excels and will make any other android phone bites the dust.The UI is intuitive and no qualms about it.Onplus is good at providing updates on time and should be fine with the support for next three years.AudioThe audio from loudspeaker is good and as everyone know there is know headphone Jack. I feel how important this Headphone jack is,especially when i started using this phone. I am yet to use the phone with BT headphones. Would update the review when i use it with my M50s.Overall SuggestionIf you decided to buy a phone list down top 5 features you need/want in a phone. If camera is listed in top 2, Do not buy this phone. Period.\\n\",\n",

Loved it!Battery is on the lower side but hey wrap charger is so fast that u don't mind that much. 20 mins of charge and  you are good to go. Feels magical how fast it charges.OnePlus could have given basic accessories in the box like headphone convertor. Have to buy them separately.Amazon delivery got late by a day but it's okay.

       " 'Camera quality is too bad. I were using the 6t and it have better camera than 7t. Resolution is too low. Every photos are kind of washed out. There is no refund. Really sad about the purchase.\\n',\n",
       " \"First day of using the 7T. Though most of the features were available with other flagship phones and at a much cheaper price I went ahead with Oneplus thanks to my flawless experience with OP5 for 2.5 years.Coming to the performance of the phone, the standout aspect would be the 90Hz refresh rate. The phone just seems to run so much smoother than its competitors. Other aspects would be the camera (obviously), dash charging(which definitely improved over Oneplus 5 and the aspect ratio of the screen which is just perfect. I feel the phone is heavier than the previous one I have used but this is not an issue at all.Will update after a few weeks as I explore the phone more as it is still too early to give a definitive review of the phone. So far, I'm loving the phone and I believe Oneplus has delivered yet again.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I have been using the oneplus device since 5 years starting from oneplus 2 then 3t now 7t and the experience i gained from oneplus is fabulous, currently I'm holding 7t the best device in the market at this price having premium feature  but with the less price.fingerprint - for security I only use fingerprint and didn't see any delay working great.Camera - they use triple camera which is similar to pro and they are best at their price.Software - as you know oneplus is known for its own software oxygen os which is closed to stock and highly customised.You can wake your screen by holding the phone, you can switch your call Bluetooth to earpiece by just putting your phone to your ears, double to wake and sleep and many more.Thank you oneplus for making wonderful phone.#oneplus\\n\",\n",
       " \"Pros : 1. Premium design - all glass and metal build which looks awesome and feels very premium in hand.2. Oxyzen OS - it was the prime reason why I switched from poco F1 to OnePlus and it certainly didn't disappoint. Absolute joy to use this device due to clean and almost stock andriod experience with nice customisations.3. Speakers - The dual stereo speakers are of top notch quality and you will never use in maximum output and still it's more louder than other flagsip devices.4. 90 hertz refresh rate - Another deal maker is this utterly smooth 90 hertz refresh rate which is the best thing in OnePlus devises. Use it to believe it.5. Camera - Better than expected rear facing camera which produces crisp and detailed pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. Selfie camera are also good.6. Screen and sensors - The fluid amoled screen is just a treat for the eyes. All the sensors are working blazingly fast like fingerprint sensor and face unlock but missing the ir blaster.Cons: 1. Battery life - Battery life is not that great will last for a day in moderate use. But the warp charger will fill the juices blazingly fast so not a deal breaker.2. Camera bump- although the design is solid and cool but there is a slight tilt when u keep the phone in flat surfaces due to the camera bump.Overall an amazing and allrounder phone from OnePlus. Just close your eyes and buy if u want a premium device in mid range price.P.S. Purchased thru Amazon prime and got SBI disc of 2000.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I read a lot review about this phone, and decided to buy this and bought it within10 minutes post launch. And my expectations were so high and it's been a week since got the phone, did this phone fulfill all my expectations? Let's discuss it in the pros and cons section.Pros:1. Oxygen OS - fluidic UI experience, the widgets are really precise and upto the point.2. Camera - super macro is not just a specification on paper it really makes wonder. Primary camera and front camera are both best in class.3. Snapdragon 855+ - Multitasking don't worry, gaming don't worry, WebEx meetings don't worry this guy can handle everything. Lightening fast processor.4. 90hz refresh rate - the fluidic display is another feature that's not merely on paper. Can feel the smoothness in the display. And hdr videos are a bliss to watch in 90hz5. Design - the design of the phone is premium I personally liked the circular camera socket. It makes the phone look like a beast.6. Complementary pouch: the silicon pouch provided with the phone is best in quality and it enhances the look of the phone, friosted silver looks well on the transparent cover.Cons:Battery: it comes with 3800 mAh on regular usuage the battery last only a day and 5-9 hours, can't one plus come with 5000 mAh battery?Fingerprint scanner: I feel the finger print scanner is not the fastest. However the face unlock is lightening fast almost no delay.Overall: OnePlus is known for providing best user experience and it has taken miles ahead with the launch of OnePlus 7T. Despite the fact that OnePlus 7 is not real value for money, it compensated the users expectations with 7T. 7T I would say best flagship phone with 855+ processor.Go for it guys.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The unit which i received made me to rethink about my purchase and Oneplus quality. Reason are:-- Never in last couple of years have i faced any heating issue with Oneplus 5,6,6t until i purchased 7t- 90hz screen refresh rate really ?? When you pack high end features relatively low priced phone (although with SD 855+) it results in screen flickering, hanging problem, and heating at the back- Despite having same can setup as 7pro ( my best frnd's) , it is quite noticeable that the pics aren't that sharp and detailed once zoomed in and seen later- Quick charge yes but quick draining of battery charge? Not a Oneplus thing despite of 3800 mah batteryI wish i could have been able to return phone but Amazon policies suck.\\n\",\n",

       " 'I am a One Plus fan. BUT When I initially bought the One Plus 7T I was appalled by the battery life and the phone heating. I made a complaint to the One Plus customer care. The next day itself I received an update. Since then the phone is not heating up and the battery life has become significantly better. STILL SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT HEREThe finger print reader and the camera could be better but acceptable.Overall I am happy now but not as thrilled as I was with their earlier phones.One plus customer care number is 18001028411The more number of callers the better chance of improvement.\\n',\n",
       " \"OnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"My two primary drivers before this was the Poco f1 and the Nokia 7plus. So my comparision will primarily be with these two.Performance: One word - snappy !Display: Gorgeous. 90hz refresh rate is clearly noticeable.Battery: Now this is the most criticised aspect of the phone , well let me tell u it is NOT Bad at all ! Believe it or not I got 5+ hrs screen on time with 38% remaining , yes u read that right ! Can't believe it ?! Lol i have screenshot of the battery usage , see it for yourself. So technically I could have easily churned out 8hrs or more screen on time if i had used it till 5% battery. What is confusing is almost every reviewer on YouTube or even user reviews have quoted a maximum of 5.5 hrs SOT at max. Now let me share some tips which i feel might helped in my case , when i first setup my phone i was to migrate my data n apps from old phone. But i did not copy the nearly 100apps i had in my nokia 7 plus , instead i just copied the contacts and messages n synced other settings with Google account. I then clean installed all the apps that i use on a regular basis i.e some 20 odd apps. I am not sure but i feel this could have helped in improving the battery life. I always keep my location off n 4g data always on + wifi when available.Camera: Now most people compare this phone n it's camera with Apple , Google , samsung flagships but fail to understand that those phones cost almost double that of this phone ! The camera takes brilliant pics in good light , low light any lighting condition u throw at it. This camera is a lot good when viewed in isolation n it is only a lil bit inferior when compared side by side with iphone 11 or pixel 3/4 , also u get wide angle camera which is missing on pixel. The camera is more than good enough for social media uploads.Conclusion: Best phone overall n VFM by a mile. If u game a lot then get ROG 2 because that has a bigger battery but as an everyday driver for normal usage this is best !\\n\",\n",

( over moderate usage)Charging speeds are just unreal, it goes full within 45 min max.Speakers are great and loud.Fingerprint sensor is just awesome and pretty fast.Face unlock is quite responsive.Oxygen OS is love.Gaming and performance is just flagship level and on par with any other top phone in the market.Camera is excellent and takes awesome shots.

Plug in for about 30-45 mins and you are good for the day.

If i am using it only music and chating it gose 100 to 50 in abut 5-6 hrs with out any heavy use. I compared battery like with OnePluse 6t at 90%  6t was giving 21hrs of life and my OnePluse 7t was giving 13 hrs of life.About face unlock system i thik there is some problem with it .

       " 'Review after ine week of usuage:-Design: The design is gorgeous with glacier blue colour having a gradient finish on the back. The camera module is somewhat a personal prefercence but in 2019 with all phones looking exactly same from back side it does give it a different look. Personally i really like the camera island type design.Screen: The screen is full hd amoled 90hz refresh rate screen. Its again gorgesous to look at,media content looks amazing,and once u start using 90hz refresh rate its dificult to go back to normal 60hz refresh rate. Its something which can be experience d and cant be explained.Camera : The triple camera set up does the job, the main sensor is 48mp sensor which takes great shots in daylight/natural light, ultrawide lens is great for taking wider view and is a superb addition to main camera. Portrait shots have good depth and does a good job at separating object with the background. The best feature has to be the macro mode,it takes some great macro shots ,with subject as close as two inches, all the food bloggers will love this feature .Performance: Fast, performance is just fast ,u throw anything at it it just doesnt lag, multitasking is butter smooth.Battery : battery is decent ,gets almost one full day around 15-17hrs at heavy usuage. But charging is super fast,plug in and u get 0-70 in almost half hour.Over all at this price point ,this phone has top notch specs,and delivers the performace thats expected out of it.Only Asus Rog phone 2 is near and in some cases better than this phone at this orice,but dats a game centric phone and may be not everyones cup of tea.Last words: If u are in market for a new one,under 40k price bracket and want all the flagship features ,great performace and software experience and all round performibg camera...Do go for this phone !!!!\\n',\n",
       " 'I replaced 3T with this masterpiece 7T. I had been using 3T for the last two and a half years and was planning to continue using it for another one or two years as 3T is still a beast as on date but unfortunately my 3T was dropped in a swimming pool and so i replaced my 3T with this amazing phone. When you are accustomed to using Oxygen OS nothing can replace the feeling and satisfaction. I have been using this 7T for last 3 days and i just want to give a quick overview of likes (which are many) and dislikes ( a very few)  as below:Likes:1. Display is amazing with 90 hz refresh rate.2. Android 10 out of the box with new features.3. Excellent photos along with Supermacromode in camera.4. Zen mode with new customizable time periods.5. Butter smooth performance. No lagging or heating at all during multitasking or gaming.Dislikes:1. i am very dissappointed with the Nightscape mode. The picture you take in nightscape is unsatisfactory. Even though the camera manages to take the extra light but it lacks the originality and is less subtle especially when you snap a persons photo in very low light, its felt like colour mush evrywhere. Infact , to my surprise i found that low light photography is very good without using nightscape. Except this, i liked the camera quality very much.2. battery is average may be becoz of the 90 hz refresh rate for e.g on average to heavy usage if i start the day with 100% battery at 7 am , the phone manages to retain 10 to 20% battery by 7 to 8 pm.Anyways , overall i am very happy with the upgrade and glad to be a part of the one plus family again. infact in our family we have OP6, OP6T, OP7 and now OP7T 🤗🤗🥰🥰\\n',\n",
       " 'Very powerful and great display.Camera is typical OnePlus where they tend to do some overprocessing, especially colour reproduction and edge sharpness. Edges of any object are not sharp, slight oil paint effect and oversaturated colours in bright light. Software update should fix it. Portrait mode gives a very great blurred background.Battery life is good with moderate use you can get through one full day. Switch off the 90Hz and you are comfortable for the day.Adaptive brightness is flawed right now but it will be fixed by bug fix i am assuming.Oxygen OS, as always is great. Dolby Atmos sound is great.Very few things to point at and many things pointing out!!Only complaint, no frosted silver in 256 gb\\n',\n",
       " 'This time one plus has nailed it with more snappier and more smoothing experience mobile ever been manufactured. Using it since a week and it is a breeze to switch between apps. RAM management has improved drastically than before. Camera is decent but provides you with the better quality than other 48 mp equipped phones currently available. Gaming mode is the best as I play alot of games most heaviest of all till now is cod mobile which runs buttery smooth and gives you pc like graphics and frames.Best buy and recommended for gamers.\\n',\n",
       " 'If you have one plus 6 or 7 do not upgraded to this there are no major changes in any form camera or anything. Before this I had one plus 6 recently I lost that phone so bought this one and Im not found  any major difference. Wide angle and that macro shot in camera are excellent where as in normal mode the color production is very poor when we compare to old OnePlus series  all photos comes as very whities. In battery it last more than one day for normal use for heavy use one day.\\n',\n",
       " \"**Will upload photos soon**Ordered this on 28th September and had it delivered a day ahead today. I'm simply mesmerized to be honest with device's overall performance. Please don't go by the YouTube review about the box and its contents cause on reality, you get just the phone packed in its box. No earphones are included in the purchase although it was mentioned in the description while buying it.Pros:1) Stunning camera and it does delivers awesome quality. I'll upload some shots soon. The slow vid and 4k 60fps are two major plus signs. The wide and the ultrawide shots are amazing along with the macro which I'm yet to explore more.2) The screen!! It's super smooth and navigation is simply effortless. The typing response is best I've ever experienced and so is the color balance that you can set as per your preference.3) The weight and build quality is premium and defines the phone as a flagship buster. I ordered the blue one and it's quite an effect on itself.4) Silicone case is included and a thin screen protector film is already applied. The case is not a usual cheap stuff but good one.5) Dolby Atmos. Now, I've been using Dolby Atmos for more than 3 years and can tell you that it's a must for people deeply rooted into music.Cons: Device has no cons in terms of looks, performance or build quality however, I expected a bit louder speaker output. The phone without the cover is quite slippery and can easily fall off so I'm being extra careful with my new baby.Overall, this did satisfy my expectations to a great limits considering the fact that I was never an OnePlus guys. This is my first.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I upgraded from one plus 7 to 7T and it's a good decision, overall thoughts on 7T.At the cost what they are selling it's definitely a good deal.The best part of the phone is it's display and the sound, to be honest, I don't feel any difference between 60 hz and 90 hz and who cares because, the display brightness and color production in 7T is  excellent, the phone when you take to outdoors, the display looks just like indoors because of the excellent brightness levels which is 1000 NITs. You would love watch movies or any content on this superb display.Sound clarity and the volume levels, simply the best, you don't feel like using headphones or need external source. It's so Crystal clear that you often wonder how's it possible to produce such crisp sound on a smart phone definitely better than one plus 7 though both have stereo speakers, this is of a different level.Battery back up is good but I felt one plus 7 was better, yes, it charges from 0 to 100 in 1 hour and the charging port is tad tight.On Camera, yes it has 2 additional lens, one telescopic and one ultra wide apart from primary lens, yes it does do the work of what it's meant for  but the processing is moderate, the noise levels are seen, I felt one plus 7 takes better photos compared to 7t, I might be wrong here.The look and feel is top notch, the Oreo camera actually enhances the looks and I see everywhere people buying blue because that's what the reviewers get from One plus, for 256gb you have only blue color but the fact is that Grey or the Fostered Silver is very Good looking than blue and it looks more premium.The face unlocking and finger scanner is fast, face unlocking does work even in dark with the screen light falling on the face.One not so feel good factor is with the haptic motor, it's week, they shouldn't have rather put it but overall it's very good phone\\n\",\n",

I have used OnePlus2 before so I decided to go for the latest OnePlus 7t and its a fabulous Phone for this price range.PROS- Awesome camera (not pixel but very good)- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast- The display is very good- Build is niceCONS- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.Also got it in Diwali offer so the deal was good.\\n\",\n",

And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNO Headset jack.Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Overall: 4.7/5 One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.\\n\",\n",

       " \"The experience with the OnePlus 7T is simply smooth and flawless. OnePlus have realised the difference a 90Hz panel makes, which is why they are including it on all their products. And you have to use it to believe it, a screen with 90Hz refresh rate is truly a joy to use (undoubtedly my favourite part of the phone). Coming to battery life, it easily lasts a day and a half for my usage but my usage is not that heavy. I only have to plug it in for 40 mins every morning before I go to work, nothing else ( charging speeds are INSANE). Lastly, as a person who is coming from a phone that was in a much lower price segment, I find the cameras to be more than adequate. However, if you truly want that top of the line camera experience, you may have to look at other flagships. We also know how quick and reliable OnePlus are with software updates and that is yet another great positive with this device. All in all, for 38K, I feel like OnePlus hit the nail on the head with this one. The phone is so slick and a joy to use on a day to day basis and comes with more or less all the bells and whistles you need.P.S: OnePlus is now offering 2 years warranty for models released including and after the 6T. So I guess that's peace of mind assured as well!\\n\",\n",

Inbuilt AI works smooth and detects the scenes in quite good manner.Telephoto, wide angle and portrait altogether compiles very good camera setup.Front Camera is similar to what we have in one plus 7.Processing is smooth like butter, no lags whatsoever. Have got about 90 apps apart from the bloated one\\'s. Opened , worked ,performs very well.Gaming is brilliant,also the new haptic feedback adds cheery on the cake for gaming.Sound quality is superb ,both the speakers are tuned and doesnt make any noise or irritation kinda even when it is full. 360\\' sound effect feels amazing.Display is very very crisp,clear and Bright. Everything is perfect. Even though its not above 1080p , but never fails.Battery - Complete 1 day backup for 100% charge. And if 1 or 2 hours goes less, WARP charging is always there.Cons -No headphone Jack.The nightscape is waste it seems. Sometimes its giving patches on the subject making it feel like its painted or something. Not good at all. Hope One plus provides updates on regular intervals for improving this.Fingerprint reader is not much fast compared to the other devices, however face unlock works perfectly fine. Expecting fingerprint reader will improve in future updates.Bundling everything in one word - \"Beast\" altogether.Go for it. Peace.#Oneplus: Never Settle\\n',\n",
       " \"Am not a OnePlus fanboy, infact this is my first OP. After 3days of usage this is what i think about this.Pros: 1-Design and build quality- the phone looks good, feels good in hand. Build quality is pretty solid. I feel the blue one looks better but that s subjective.2- Display- it is just gorgeous. The screen brightness is nothing like I have seen before. The 90 hz refresh rate is simply awesome.3- camera- the only two phones that I feel have better camera than this are S10 plus (also note 10) and the 11pro. There are few features in this that even those phones do not offer. Considering that this is almost half the price, I would consider this a win for OP.4- Oxygen OS- my last device was an Android one phone, so I was used to the stock Android experience. Oxygen OS takes the same experience and kicks it up a notch. It's just so smooth and provided some awesome customization.5- Charging speed- This has to be one of the fastest charging phone out there. Goes from 0 to 50 in about 20 mins.Cons- 1- no notification LED. 2- Haptics could be better.3- Display should have been quad hd at this price point.4- stupid notch. 5- A type C to 3.5 mm adapter should have been provided in the box. 5- Could use a bigger battery. 6- The always on display only works when you lift up or tap the phone\\n\",\n",

But after using it for one week you'll get to know about this.I have never expected this from oneplus. I have been using it since 23rd oct, every day iam getting a new problem..from day one, main issue is phone slightly hanging and i have used oneplus 5t before but i have seen that 5t hanged.And yes this 7t consuming more data! When you are not good wifi user you should have to turn on data saving mode! Otherwise in few months your data plan bills will reach to the mobile cost.And moreover phone unlocking it self, when you are not even showing your face are fingerprint scanner also. Ihave tried it many ways later i come to know this. After restarting mobile it's getting better.Every day iam getting a new problem. Waiting for better software update for this bugs.Battery also not that impressive. yes We have fast charger but i dont think that's the solution.And also iam facing some software issues ( took screen shot, posted the picture in review)I don't know whether every mobile has the same problem or just mine, but this is what i can conclude about this 7t!Felt bad that i have switched from 5t to 7t.\\n\",\n",

       " 'This is my first Oneplus phone and bought this after a looooot of research. Happy to realize that my choice wasn\\'t bad. Yeah, if they release OP8 at a lesser price within next 2 months, it\\'s gonna hurt, but that\\'s the reality these days.Pros:1. Best camera in this range, hands down. There are no second questions as of now. Color profiles vary a little when you switch between cameras but I\\'m sure next update from oneplus will solve this.2. Fastest phone in this range. ROG 2 is another option but that\\'s for gamers and is not a practical phone for most people.3. Display 90Hz is super fluid. It isn\\'t quad HD unlike 7 pro or 7T pro. But this is the best in this price range.4. Software: Android 10 plus Oxygen OS. I bought this phone for this combo. Best as of now. Zen mode, night mode, reading mode, chromatic mode, greyscale mode, digital wellbeing, dark mode, the list goes on. You name it; this phone has it. Love it 3000.5. Speakers: Beast. Very loud and crisp.6. Design: 20:9 makes it easy to handle. Weight is balanced, can manage most stuff with one hand. Rear can design may be a problem for some. Camera bump isn\\'t an issue at all since everyone is going to use a case. My Moto Z had similar bump, the case takes care of it.7. Battery: I wad skeptic about 3800mah plus 90Hz display combo. But this phone surprised me. Battery life is really good, easily 5.30 to 6hrs SOT depending on your usage in 90Hz. If you are traveling you can always switch to 60Hz for longer life. Plus the super amazing charger. I think few early reviews dint have the latest oxygen update which should have improved the battery life.Cons:1. No 3.5mm output.2. No type-c to 3.5mm converter or type-c headphones in the box: Oneplus could at least give people a 100rs converter for buying a 40k phone. Who wants the useless super fancy box right?3. No IR blaster.4. No notification LED.5. No \"always on\" display.6. No micro sd slot.I can\\'t think of any other con. Will update if I find any.Adding some amazing night mode pics shot by both stock camera and gcam. All these pics were shot at 10PM.Battery screenshot: Dint play any games. Usage was mostly whatsapp, chrome, camera, and youtube. Dark Mode enabled. 90Hz enabled.Edit.Second screenshot: Includes 1hr 37 min pubg, 1hr 15min youtube. Single sim, wifi and 4g data always on, did not use GPS much.\\n',\n",
       " \"Inside the box:-You only get the handset and the charger and a transparent case, you won't don't get any headphones.Pros:-1) The one thing that attracted me to buy this phone is its Screen. Believe me it's the best part of this phone. You can clearly feel the difference between a 60hz display and a 90hz display. The amoled panel reproduces amazing colors and it also gets decently bright.2) Duel Speakers, this has 2 speakers. One in the bottom of the phone and one in the earpeice. I think this has Dolby Atoms as well. You ll have a really good experience when it comes to audio.3) The phone is really smooth and works like butter thanks to its 90hz Screen and top end specs, switching between the apps, scrolling feels really fast.4) Cameras - the cameras on this are pretty decent and the front facing camera is not a pop up one so no moving parts. The notch is small.5) Super fast charging - phone comes with the fast charger inside the box and it's crazy fast to charge the phone. It's faster than OnePlus 5.6) The Screen - ohhh the screen.. viewing content on this screen is mind blowing.. its the best part of this phone.Cons:-1) Size of the phone, when it comes to the dimensions of the phone I think it gets really tricky to handle this phone while typing or vertical use. Its a bit heavy as well. The phone is a bit thick as well as compared to Oneplus 5 my privious phone which was the perfect size and weight.2) I think the battery backup could have been better. The screen eats up the battery. I was not using my phone that intensively and still the battery drained faster as compared to my previous phone. (Fast charging helps though)3) No headphone jack - well this was going to be the deal breaker for me in buying this phone but I went for it. This phone doesn't have a headphone jack and also OnePlus doesn't even provide the type C to 3.5mm adapter out of the box.. will have to buy it separately or use bluetooth headphones which will again have a toll on the battery life.4) The big camera bump on the back. Yes it's too big and if you don't use a backcover you phone will always be uneven on the surface. It looks not that great too.5) And one thing that I noticed is that this phone comes with a pre applied screen guard, but the plastic doesn't cover the whole screen area, so when I had the back gestures enabled from the right bottom corner my finger used to scrach on that screen guard which was very unpleasant and I was worried that constant scratching might loosen the screen guard and it would peel off or something, so I had to disable those gestures and use the on Screen buttons to navigate.6) I dont know if its the software issue or the camera itself but the picture quality of the cameras is not that great or what I was hoping for.All in all.  This is a good phone for the price that it comes.\\n\",\n",

Camera is a treat to watch, macro mode just kills it!!Peace of Advice: Put some decent protection to 7T with good hardcases to keep the all glass body safe. I have put UAG case to this task!!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\xa0Just finished setting it up and initial impressions have been very good. Although I have to say I was expecting a big box which had some extra goodies, like the many youtubers (including Indian ) had been showing. I would suggest OnePlus to at least include them as a part of a deal. Any way once I started using the phone, all my complaints started fading away. That 90 Hz display gives a butter smooth touch experience.2 days usage Update:*About the big box goodies mentioned in previous review above, they are available on OnePlus portal. So be ready to shell out money for the same.*camera is not in the league of iphone 11 or Galaxy Note 10 or even Pixel 3 but it ain't that bad either. But Macro mode is a big saviour.*Display is definitely the best part of the phone, along with the processor SD 855+*Stereo Speakers can be pretty loud and clear*Battery is again not as good as iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10+ but it would be enough for a day's usage.

       " \"I have been using OnePlus 7T for the past week and based on my hands on experience I would say that this is undoubtedly the best smartphone under 40k. According to me the best past of OP 7T is the charging capability it has and I must say I have never seen somthing like this. The phone runs roughly 10-12 hours on one charge and for some, it's a bummer, but with 30 min. of charge you get ~70% battery, which in my opinion is superb.Some are saying its camera is not up to the mark but in my opinion it is superb moreover one must not forget that its camera is compared with iPhone 11(which is industries benchmark for camera comapison). Even if it doesn't exeed in comparison with iPhone 11's camera it is still way better than other companies camera in that price range.All in all I would recommend OnePlus 7T without any doubt.\\n\",\n",

Very sufficient for me as unexpected from this 3800 mah battery only.Moreover camera quality is just mind blowing specially front camera and rear portrait mode and nightscape mode is awesome and also macro mode is just fantastic one...beat every segment of flagship....not its time to screen....so its like butter in ur hand....just one word to explain this mini moster is 'AWESOME'. My first oneplus phone it is and i just Love Oneplus.\\n\",\n",

The phone went from 13% to 98% in just 40 mins. Oxygen OS , as always, is great to use. Cameras are also great this time, specially the inclusion of wide angle camera, although I wish it would have been a little wider. And I miss OIS on telephoto lens! That would have made the phone complete. The speakers are loud and clear, so no complaints there.

       " \"Here's an honest review of the OnePlus 7T.Want a best phone under 40k go for this one without thinking twice. I'm saying this because i have literally researched every other phone falling under this category i.e., the ₹40000 bar.Pros1. Great display.  Seriously awesome display vivid colours and great brightness outdoors plus its a flat screen which is a big thumbs up coz I'm not really into curved displays for however pleasing they may look but in practicality not to good.2. Battery.  Battery life is just marvelous. Lasts for me about a whole day doing normal usage and 6-7 hours of heavy usage.Also Warp charge is just plain Awesome. Takes about 45 min to fully charge from 10-15%.3. Sound.  Dual stereo speakers are just great. Immersive sound experience. Loud and clear4. Oxygen OS  It is the best there is without any doubt. Better than samsung one ui or any other.5. Camera  Triple camera system is really good. Wide angle is 117° so a little short than other wide angles which are 120° but doesn't make any difference. Great pictures and videos.The macro shot is just great. Indoor and outdoor clicks are good. If your thinking iphone comparable quality just don't but is great for its price. Wouldn't regret buying it.Cons1. Minor bugs here and there that can be fixed with updates which is what OnePlus is good at.Updates are frequent and shows that they work really hard at this.2. Some people won't like the circular camera system so I'm writing in the cons but its just a matter of personal view. It doesn't bother you with anything.3. No 3.5 mm to type-c connector in the box.4. Some won't like the plastic TPU case but that's what you get.Anyhow it is the best phone there is right now better than OnePlus 7 pro and 7T pro actually.So no need to worry just go for it.If any questions just ask.If you are missing headphone jack buy a Bluetooth headset. I would recommend Sony WI400. 15 hrs battery. 1 hour charging time with warp charger ofcourse and pretty good range. Also great base and awesome sound. Priced at ₹3500.\\n\",\n",

Fluid and super fast software experience as expected from one plus oxygen os with Android 10.2. Battery life is decent with 90hz and amazing with 60hz mode . With normal usage easily lasts 1day with 90hz. Got more than 1 day with 60hz display mode.3. Charging is crazy fast. 30 minutes of charging for a day works for me.4. Camera quality is good and macro mode is fun to use. Camera bump is bit ugly though5. Sound quality is good and loud because of the dual front facing speakers.6. Onscreen fingerprint sensor is decently fast not as good as the actual sensor.7.  Display is great. Phone looks and feels premium in hand.8. No headphone jack.😟Overall a great phone.\\n',\n",

I'm becoming a huge fan of OnePlus thanks to the top quality devices they manufacture at affordable rates.

Its worth buying it.\\n\",\n",

We all know OP makes best Android mobiles and Oxygen OS is incomparable. Touch is smooth as silk and performance outstands every other Android phones. The only thing I want to mark out is the battery. OP could have given atleast 4k mah battery. It drains really fast after continuous use.But yeah, WARP charging is totally crazy. It's unbelievable.

The competition is offering same or better at low price point.If you want a OS with no bloat  and consider Oneplus brand to be good than you can buy one, but the phone is no more a value for money.If you care for value for money settle elsewhere.\\n',\n",
       " \"After having used almost all their phones until OP6. I took a break for a year from it and now I bought OP7T.1. The phone looks decent, not a huge fan of CAMERA BUMP but gradually it won't matter much.2. The screen looks good but if you are not gamer 60 to 90hz shift will not be a much change.3. SD855+ is just tuning the GigaHz and just a marketing gimmick from SD855.4. The already applied screen protector is the cheapest thing I have seen on any phone till now. #VERYCHEAP.5. Battery life is poor. If on 90hz, you definitely have to charge the phone twice. SOT of max 4hrs (Observation after 15 days of usage and multiple resets). At 60Hz max SOT of 5-6hrs. #LikeAnyOther15kphone.The charger goes 0-50% in half an hour. 0-70% in half an hour is a PURE LIE!6. UI is seamless but with so many bugs which nobody, I repeat nobody on Youtube talks(I guess they get paid for reviews). Auto-Brightness is a big issue. it never reads the natural lighting properly. Screen twitched when changing the wallpapers.  OnePlus Launcher sucks 5-6% of battery every day.My conclusion is please be a SMART USER. OP7 at 30k ( extra less with offers ) is way better than that of ADDING 8000 RUPEES for less battery life ( due to 90hz display ) and MARKETING GIMMICK OF SHIFT TO SD855+ from SD855. And if you have bought OP7T then their new launch 7T PRO is the device in a hurry. Don't feel bad because they launched a new phone.Note: Even new Pixel 4XL is on SD855.ALSO, A SUGGESTION AFTER HAVING BOUGHT A ONEPLUS DEVICE, JUST REFRAIN YOURSELF FROM BUYING A NEW PHONE FOR ATLEAST TWO YEARS.

Don't tell me that I'm the only one with the problem. I've use LG, Samsung and an Iphone and have never faced such an issue. My first purchase of Oneplus and will be my last. Should never have trusted in the first place.\\n\",\n",

One cannot carry the wrap charger everywhere.Wrap charger is great but that dosent call for total lack for battery optimisation,especially when you are putting a powerhungry 855+ and battery consuming 90htz screen.Rest of the phone is just awesome.

       " 'I have been using a Samsung Galaxy S8 for the last 2 years and switched to the OnePlus 7t 256 GB a couple of weeks ago. My feedback based on the 2 weeks of rigorous use vis-à-vis the Galaxy S8 –Pros:- Amazing 30w Warp Charge is the fastest I have seen. My rigorous use means I need a big battery and being a Samsung loyalist had considered the M30s. However, the sub par specs other than that massive battery on the M30s meant I went for the 7t and I am happy that I chose this.- The finger print sensor is much better than the Samsung S8 and the haptics are also quite good. Overall the cell phone also feels faster than the S8 in day to day usage and the data access is also visibly faster.- One grouse I always had with the S8 was that the speaker loudness whether on a phone call or listening to the single speaker was terrible for a flagship phone. By comparison the stereo speakers of the 7t are brilliant. I actually have to turn down the speakers listening to YouTube videos it is that loud.- The box comes with the fantastic warp charger and surprise, surprise a basic transparent case. I purchased a more robust case as I am prone to dropping my phones but it is a nice gesture by OnePlus. The idiots should probably have included a USB C to 3.5mm jack as well but then there’s no end to asking for freebies.Cons:- The biggest negative is the screen quality. I don’t mind the 1080p resolution as I also ran my S8 in 1080p to save battery. The problem is that the 7t screen never feels vibrant like the S8 despite adjustments. The back lighting is inconsistent and feels patchy. And for some reason, the Auto backlight adjustment seems to always set up the screen darker than it should. In summary, nothing comes close to a Samsung AMOLED.- Another aspect of the screen that bugs me is that the oleo phobic coating on the screen or rather the pre applied screen guard is terrible. The screen always looks dirty as compared the superb black mirror look of my Samsung S8.- The reason I almost didn’t purchase the 7t was that it offers no SD Card support. I did opt for the larger 256 GB variant but I would still prefer the choice of putting in my own micros SD. I also don’t like the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack but that doesn’t affect me much.  I have shifted to the Jabra 65t Elite BT headphones for everyday work. I use a Dragonfly Red DAC with OneMore Quad Drivers for music listening on flights.- Using the phone over a 40 minutes drive with Android Auto I found the phone heating up. Samsung S8 never had this issue because Samsung is extra cautious about heat management after the exploding Notes episode.So far so good with the OnePlus 7t. It is superb value as compared to the Samsung S10 range. The S10e that has specs at par with the S8 of nearly 3 years ago is a rip off at 50k+ and the other S10 phones are daylight robbery of even greater magnitudes.Simply put, I take my phone selection very seriously and frankly there seems to be no phone that can offer better value and user experience at this price range.\\n',\n",
       " \"OnePlus 7T:I rarely change mobile phones only when and if it is required. My average mobile lasts me 3-5 years before I change one.I opted to go for 7T this time. My review for past one week is :Design- I believe this is purely based on personal preference. For me I really like the overall design and color. It does not feel cheap and has premium feel to it.Display: The is display is a gem and feast to the eyes while at 90hz. The games work smoothly and the touch response is really good.  My eyes do not feel strained and you also get the option to change it to 60hz to save battery. If coming from a layman's perspective you will even enjoy the 60hz display just because the display is Crystal clear.-DC Dimmimg is addition feature which the OnePlus has added to avoid screen flicker at low brightness and some of the users have been still facing the issue. From my personal experience I did not face any of such issues and the feature worked flawlessly. I believe this is more of certain product issue and this is something which OnePlus needs to address. If they don't mean to settle just like their OnePlus 7 range then they need to address this issue.Camera: Camera works flawlessly. However, Some people liked the camera bump on 7T and some didn't. Personally, I don't mind till the time it serves it's purpose. Just need to take a bit care of it. You will enjoy clicking pictures from this camera. The macro lens provides a very good perspective while clicking the pictures. Although, I feel the camera does make the pictures a little warmer. The nightscape mode provides a clear pictures at night. However, I think it could have been better. The pictures could also have been a little more sharper.Overall pretty good camera.UI: It works flawlessly with regular updates. Yes, I already got one within a week of owning it. Nothing more to say here.Fingerprint reader: One of the fastest scanner I have come across with multiple animated options to choose from.Overall- 4/5I'm enjoying using this phone and I have been appreciating the thought process gone though everything while making this device to provide such a beast.-No heating issue. Fnatic mode, Gaming mode works efficiently. All the games including COD, PUBG, Asphalt, Temple Run work brilliantly at Max settings.***Also you get the back cover and screen protector with it. If there is any update on regards to the over all functioning of the device then I will make sure to update it over here.\\n\",\n",

This phone is build so perfect and beautiful, my iphone user friends are even jealous with the design and make.Pros:# beautifully premium design with glass back and matte but metallic looking glacier finish.

Not pricey not cheap.# battery life is awesome, considering 90hz refresh rate and samoled display with 855+ processor.# everything else u cna think about is pros only.Cons:# gboard google keyboard is okayish as compared to apple and samsung keyboards, im getting misclicks and misspelled words, accuracy is too much i think, apple has so much optimised keyboards, so does samsung, i think oneplus and google will work on it.# camera performace is just fine in low light tbh, apple 11 will surely shot better pics in low light i think.# i hv watched on youtube about life of back glass, they said it is prone to develop scratches over time, i dont know though, lets see.# headfone jack was removed. My heart broke, its not a good movement, we have senheiser and all 3.5mm headfone jacks, why r u removing these guys, its basic thing, shifting from micro usb to type c usb plug is different thing, but this is not at all fair, we are forced to buy third party connectors which practically ruins the atmos effects, many of us dont like wireless. Thumb down here. As a gesture of goodwill you could provide connector in the box at least, yeah its not there in the box, buy from outside.# no colour option for 256gb version as of now, only glacier blue, not a big issue, but its a bit funky.

Overall this is a very beautiful phone to have your hands-on.Just 1 issue I have is, I didn't get a 3.5mm to type C connector.That's it, thank you :)\\n\",\n",

Never faced any issue with any phone even after 5 years my oneplus one is still working.Now come to the 7T, I am using this phone for the last 4 days and really happy with the performance, oneplus always used a top-notch processor with 8Gb Ram and Oxygen OS just make everything flawless. This 90MHz screen on oneplus is the reason to opt for this device you can clearly see the difference in your device screen and oneplus 7T screen every single Fram is fast and smooth on this screen. Now they also improved sound quality with Dolby sound, I was using 6T and it is a very huge improvement in sound quality. Now come to the camera yes camera is very good at 7T but do not expect quality like iPhone and pixel, 7T camera can take very good shot and the way they give us the freedom to use the combination of three lenses is very useful I love this quick toggle between lense. The battery is decent for me, I am a heavy use with all the time internet on easily getting 1 and half day battery and wrap charger is cherry on top this is the fastest oneplus charger only tool 45 minutes to charge phone from 20 to 100.

In less than 40 to 45 mins, it will hit 0% to 100%# 90 Hz refresh is lightning fast and smooth.# Pretty good in-display fingerprint sensor.# Needless to say, this is the best phone for PUBG, COD and other high-end games.Cons:# Battery backup might let you down, with 3800 mAH battery it lasts only 15 to 18 hours with moderate usage. If you play games expect it to drain sooner.# No headset in the box, which could be a disappointment for the first time OnePlus users.# And this phone have USB type C port for earphones, which is not quite uncommon though.Having these minor hiccups, hands down this is certainly the best premium phone in the market at this price range.

The performace of this phone is amazing and is upto the mark. Overall you can also use it for vloging as I will be and it shoots the best video for you.

I find myself looking for excuses to look at it/use it while I'm at work, and I'm fighting a losing battle in that aspect. I've accepted it.I only wish there were better cases for the phone as the transparent one provided with the packaging looks cheap.

Overall happy with the service, they were prompt and responsive.5. Charging- Warp charge 30T is the best! Charges 3800mah battery in less than an hour.6. Stereo speakers- loud and crisp7. Notch is little bit smaller than OnePlus 7Cons-1. Battery- Not upto expectations, earlier I owned OP5 which had 3300 mah battery which later more than a day on average usage. But this phone just clears 24 hrs on moderate usage and if we play games like pubg, it just can't reach 24 hrs. Though I get about 5-6 hrs screen on time which is good.2. No 3.5mm jack- It can be a con for this device but I assure you that listening from type-c is much better than the jack, try to experience it yourself.Overall, if you want a phone like OP7pro/7Tpro at less price and can give up curved display, I think this can be the best choice.

Oxygen OS should include that. Gcam helps but, thats about it.2.sound clarity over Bluetooth! Don't get me wrong!Its loud! Its really really good and music is ok. However, bass that deep bass is not good and vocals are not clear. On Spotify, you may get a better experience but on gana its poor.There is something to do with Dolby that you cannot switch off! I am using ath sr30 bt from audio Technica and Mi phones have better sound over Bluetooth!So those are the cons! The fact that it shattered on the bend test is also something one needs to take into account!

DISPLAY & BUILD QUALITY-Superb AMOLED screen which is very bright, good in sunlight too-90HZ refresh rate is an added\\xa0bonus.\\xa0-If you don't mind that notch, all else is good.- The form factor is compact and small, making it easy to hold and operate with one hand.-No Always On display option and No LED notification light.\\xa0\\xa0-The front and back of phone is thankfully not a fingerprint magnet but attracts lots of dust.-Overall design of the phone is very good, except for the camera bump. But the front of the phone looks similar to every other cheap notch-wala phones in the market.-I wish there was water and dust resistance IP rating.\\xa0-No headphone jack and no earphones in the package. Atleast a 3.5mm converter should be included in the package.-No IR Blaster.2. OPERATING SYSTEM-Latest Oxygen OS 10 and Android 10.... best in class.-OS has lot of customization and is very fluid and easy to use.\\xa0- Does not come with much bloatware and unwanted apps can be uninstalled.3. CAMERA QUALITY-Both cameras of this phone are really good for daytime.-Low light pics and nightscape mode are hopeless.-Picture processing takes a bit long, especially during night time.-Major problem is the Portrait Mode, which doesn't work properly. I don't see much background blurred.\\xa0-Wide-angle shots and Macro shots are good.-I don't like the camera bump, but with the cover on, it is not a hindrance.-Some more functionalities and settings in the camera are missing.4.\\xa0 BATTERY LIFE-3800 MAH battery is quite adequate for about 7 hours of screen time.-The 30T warp charger makes up for the battery issue to some extent as charging happens super quick.-Battery drains faster at 90Hz refresh rate, so i changed it to 60Hz as I am not a gamer.-I found no heating issues with this phone, but gamers or heavy users can tell about that.5. SECURITY-Face unlock and On-screen fingerprint reader are amazingly fast and it unlocks the phone at the blink of an eye.-The best part is the screen lights up at night, so face unlock works like a charm even in a dark room.\\xa0-Technology here is unmatched, flagship quality but I find the face unlock unreliable as it recognizes my face in the mirror too and unlocks it.POINTERS FOR AMAZON1. Provided me one day delivery for FREE.... thanks Amazon.2. Proper invoice not provided in package or in email.3. Bank offers and discounts made it a sweet deal.POINTS FOR ONEPLUS1.

Have been using it since the last 4 days and here is a quick analysis:1. Processor is really fast. You can easily notice it as you flip between the apps2. Face recognition is super quick. At times before u even manage to put ya thumb for finger scanning the phone gets unlocked. Face recognition even in low lights is pretty impressive.3. The camera precision is brilliant. One can take stunning pics and with portrait mode on the selfie too makes it even better. Have not tested long distance and night pics so cannot comment on that as of now.4. Game mode is really cool if you are a gaming person which I am.5. The display is really bright and vibrant. You can easily feel the difference from the earlier phone that you were using6. Battery life is really excellent. I spend a lot of time on calls during office hrs and game while free time. But the battery really fights out time easily. Also the quick charge is super awesome. It barely takes like an hour for 100% battery. Just plug in for 15 mins and you can easily charge the battery good 40%.7. The phone comes with a soft transparent case so you need not bother with the drops.8. Loads of inbuilt features that will only add to the delight once you start exploring them.Bad pointJust that the charging cable is round instead of the flat cable which is not that simple to twirl and lock. Flat cable was a lot simpler. Also the cable length is standard1 mtr. I would have preferred if they gave 3 mts.\\n',\n",

       " \"It's been less than a week that I am using this phone and I think I made the best decision to pay a little extra and go for OnePlus 7t instead of OnePlus 7. I had also considered going for Samsung S10e but OnePlus took my heart with its feature richness as explained below out of which half of the features are missing in Samsung S10E.I think the display of OnePlus is far far better than the display of Samsung Phones which I considered to be the best so far.The specs provided are too good for the price. The specific specs that I loved are -1. Fluid Amoled Display2. SPEEEDDD (the 7th generation of OnePlus phones is known for its speed and it holds to that promise very well). Samsung stutters after a while with speed.3. Dolby speakers (you really don't need Bluetooth Speakers anymore)4. How can I forget Oxygen OS! If you're into hassle free yet minimum customisable OS then this one's for you.5. Camera is great too. Look in the attached samples for clarity in outdoor lighting conditions. Also a wide angle shot which does a great job with the field area covered.6. Playing PubG in gaming mode at top-end levels is super smooth and flawless.7. Fingerprint Sensor is pretty fast. Didn't experience even a single moment of complaining about indisplay sensor.8. Battery life decent enough for 9-10 hours on moderate usage but the Warp Charger makes up for all the lacking points here. Thats too quick.9. Super Macro is amazing. I loved to play around with it. Please have a look at samples which were taken keeping the camera too close to the subject and the details captured were awesome.The only con that I particularly didn't like was a - No headphone jack but when you see the overall Package. It really don't matter to me much.It looks premium and IT IS A PREMIUM ANDROID EXPERIENCE. Myself being an FANdroid lover, this is the best Android I have ever used.*Reasons to buy or not to buy -If you love Android and don't want to spend more than 40K, than go for it without thinking twice !!!Unless and until you're an Apple fan and really want to go for iPhone 11 which is nearby the price range of this, than this is the best option in this price segment.\\n\",\n",

One thing I hate after switching from my OnePlus 6 to this is that they didn't include the previous gesture that was present in Android 9. I checked in 7, 7 Pro and they had it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'This is the fourth one plus phone I had bought after one plus 2, 5 and 6T. One plus 2 just gave up recently after 4 years of usage. Decided to replace it with this new phone. No complaints so far with butter smooth operation on Android 10 and oxygen OS. My usage is limited, I have been charging only once for a day and by changing the refresh rate to 60HZ  the charge on phone really stands out. The camera is good but could have been amazing.  Overall a amazing piece of product for this price.\\n',\n",
       " 'Pros :1. Excellent display2. 90 hz is just an extra benefit, scrolling is very fast.3. In display fingerprint is very fast, so is the face unlock.4. Dual speakers are very loud and clear, Dolby Atmos is a charm.5. 30t wrap charge is very fast, charges from 0 to 100 in 55 minutes.6. Battery life is very good, easily getting 8-9 hrs SOT on wifi and 6 hrs on mobile data, standby time also good, all these sot on 90hz and mobile data always on.7. Wide angle camera and night sight camera is additional advantage, night sight is comparable to pixel.8. Haptic feedback is very good.9. Performance at top notch with 855 plus.10. Multitasking great with 8gb ram.Cons:1. Using pixel 2xl from long time, potrait mode is not as good as pixel, infact it is best on pixel.2. Ambient display is having bug in most of the devices, tap to wake and lift to wake not working lot of time, one plus please provide fix for this.Tips: use GCam for best camera results.Final verdict: Dont think and just get one plus 7t if having 38k budget.\\n',\n",

These new phones have Type C as headphone jacks but Oneplus didn't even provide with a Type - C Converter. which is a drawback.2. Whatsapp hangs when on the video call. I cannot use WhatsApp while being on the video call.If the company can rectify these problems it's an amazing phone to have.\\n\",\n",

Compared i to OnePlus 6 battery is much better.

Happy to join the one plus community, a good replacement to my iphone 6s. Satisfied user👌\\n',\n",
       " \"This is my review after 2 days :Screen: Coming from a screen with a higher resolution than the 7T, I was weary about the screen. However the AMOLED screen on this phone blew me away with it's contrast and brightness. The 90Hz screen is another killer feature. A lot of people still seem to wonder if it makes a difference, I think it does. A friend of mine who hadn't heard of this phone before tried it and was immediately impressed by the smooth scrolling and animations.This is most definitely the best aspect of this phone.Performance: This is phone is rapid! I haven't encountered a hiccup yet. I do not game and hence cannot comment on the gaming performance. However I am a heavy user and didn't find anything that slowed down this phone. I'm also very pleased with the clean Android experience with Oxygen OS's useful features. Both face recognition and the finger print scanner are fastBattery: This is where I was seriously doubting the capabilities of this phone. However I'm pleased to report that I've had more than 6.5 hours of screen on time on both days. This included a lot of YouTube and Netflix using the phones speakers. This phone should easily get you through a day of use. I had also kept WiFi, Mobile Data (4G) and Location on at all times. Unless you are expecting something that lasts for 2 days , this phone won't disappoint. The new Warp charge 30T is amazing as well.Speakers: The speakers are something I did not consider much about while purchasing this device. But they've impressed me immensely. Dialogue is crisp and it gets plenty loud. I did try using my wired earphones with a OnePlus USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor and I didn't have any issues with the sound.Cameras: I have not tested the camera enough to post a review about them, nor am I a photographer. I will update this review when I do take more picturesHand feel: The phone feels solidly built. I did expect it to be heavier. It doesn't feel heavy at all and the weight is distributed very well, making it very easy to hold. Make no mistake, it is a large phone. However I found it much easier to handle than the 7 Pro which I was considering thanks to the flat screen, slightly narrower width and the evenly distributed weight.I do wish they did provide a USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor in the box. (3.5mm jack would be ideal. But that ship has sailed). Apart from this minor gripe, I'm very happy with this purchase.(For context, I have used a Samsung S5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7 Plus and Nokia 8 as my daily drivers before this)\\n\",\n",
       " \"First of all the phone is really great. The phone does have its pros and cons. Im writing the review for people who are thinking of buying this.Pros:1) Snapdragon 855+ processor with 90Hz of refresh rate means the phone doesn't lag or hang. If it does check with the buyer. Most people on amazon dont check the buyer and end up crying foul.2) Finger print and face unlock its really impressive with the speed.3) It has a customized Oxygen OS and that works pretty well with the kind of customization the brand has put in.4) Design and the matt finish gives the phone a stylish look.5) Battery life is really good. I have almost 300 plus apps and I easily use it for a day or two with all the surfing and writing mails. The warpt charger charges the phone somewhere between 30 to 45 minutes.6) Dolby speakers and colors of videos bring it to life.Cons:1) Doesn't have a ear jack and the brand doesn't provide an earphone which is pretty bad as a user is paying close to 37k to 40k.2) I thought the camera is ok. They could have done much more with the quality. Tag disappointed with it.3) The phone did heat up initially raising a concern but over time it hasnt been that bad.4) Not sure about the quality of buttons and lastly they havent officially mentioned anything about waterproof and dust proof.Overall its a good phone. Hope it gives a bit of insight for people who want to buy this phone. Cheers.\\n\",\n",
       " '1. Not as good as expected.2. Voice quality is too bad.3. Video recording quality is also not upto the mark.4. Battery draining fast.5.

Amazon is not allowing me to return the product which is strictly not acceptable.8. Pathetic user interface.Overall dissatisfied.... one should not pay such huge amount only for Camera quality.\\n',\n",
       " \"Love the forested silver color.! Display is just awesome, the finger print scanner and the face unlock combo is so fast that It feels instantaneous on press of the power button, camera and picture quality could be even more better which I hope will be taken care of in upcoming updates, performance wise it's a beast once you enable the developers option and change the animation to 0.5X scale the phone just blazes through, getting solid one day battery after 6.3hrs of gaming(call of duty, pubg), lots of browsing and songs(video) and no heating issues yet, though I doubt it has the cooling unit like oneplus 7 and oneplus 7 pro and oneplus 7t pro. The speakers are  way too loud which is a good thing for movies, games and songs, bad thing that even the earpiece at the lowest level of volume is loud enough that the person next to you can hear the conversation pretty accurately in an office or silent environment.  Best buy for the money needless to upgrade to oneplus 7t pro and oneplus pro just for the pop-up camera(which can be annoying when you have have face unlock enabled as it will pop up every single time you try to unlock the phone eventually will worn-out the motor lot faster) and higher display resolutions which saves loads of money. Fastest charging I have ever seen. And hardwares specs are all upto the current trend that you don't have to even think of upgrading your phone for a very long time.\\n\",\n",
       " 'It is the best phone till date. It is so smooth in every tasks.PROS:1) Display: Display is buttery smooth. 90Hz display gives you a smooth performance.2) Battery: Battery is not so bad as it is being said by reviewers as it is giving me around 1 and half day of battery life in aggressive usage. I play heavy games a lot like pubg and Call of duty. And still the performance is nice.3) Camera: Believe me the pictures coming out from this phone are perfect. I am a professional photographer and i am pretty impressed by the performance of the camera.And the videos are also good and so are slomos.4) Sound: Stereo speakers of this phone are insane. I have used many stereo speaker smartphones and i am telling you the speakers from this device gives better sound.5) Charging: The phone charges from 0-100% in 60-70 mins. What else you want now?CONS:1) No 3.5mm jack as you all know. And the company is not providing any 3.5mm to type-c connector.2) No IP Rating. However, the company said that the phone can bear water splashes but the certification is what makes us comfortable.3) No wireless Charging. The device has a glass back but then too there is no wireless charging.But these cons are not a deal breaker.Note: At this price range OnePlus 7T is a great deal. Go for it blindly.\\n',\n",

       " \"Everything about the OnePlus 7t is absolutely great as far the performance is considered. But one thing which still bothers me is that, it crashed while I was playing Call Of Duty mobile. Like literally I couldn't finish the game at all. Now I'm no expert, but one thing is certainly obvious that OnePlus 7t is a device which should be able to withstand high graphic games in extreme modes. However, I doubt if it could have been a software problem from the game itself unable to run smoothly on my device or was it my phone's problem? I don't know...all things considered #PUBG works Great on my phone even in extreme graphic OnePlus 7t can pull it off without a sweat. But I gotta tell you though your hands are gonna sweat it out.😜#Fingerprint Scanner.It's okay and not so fast as those dedicated finger prints sensors I'd say, but sometimes it failed to recognize my own finger prints!! So I'd give it 6 out of 10. And I've got my reasons for rating it that way and it's pretty convenient if I'd explain why, besides it's much easier to understand practically.😅#Camera PerformanceIt's pretty great I love the way OnePlus represents their Camera Performance although it's not up to Max. Nightscape mode works better when there's more light in the background.🥰\\n\",\n",

The phone is smooth runs efficiently even if there are multiple apps running at the background.I transferred the entire data through one plus switch app and it took 20 minutes to transfer 40 Gb data. the finger print scanner and face recognition features are just cool. The battery has a great back up. It doesn't exhaust easily. The phone box contained a silicone case and a prefit tempered glass. The phone interface is new and different than other Samsung Smartphones which looks alike.. The company offered one year screen replacement through acko insurance which is a blessing in disguise.Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone..\\n\",\n",

Battery life is awesome, getting around 7 hours of screen usage time with social networking and YouTube at moderate brightness, 4-5 hours gaming at moderate brightness. With warp charging, I got from 11% to 93% in around 55 minutes. There is no overheating even after extensive gaming. Performance is ultrasmooth with SD855+ and the awesome 90Hz display. I have played only COD on this phone. With max graphics quality, high frame rate and anti-aliasing turned on, the game still plays very smooth. Great colours with accurate blacks on the AMOLED screen but max brightness is slightly short of adequate. You'll struggle a little bit under the sun. Adaptive brightness needs fixing. Tends to turn the brightness down too much. The stereo speakers would've been amazing if both of them were front-facing but only is. They're still loud and clear. Multitasking is exceptional with apps not shutting down even after gaming. Social media feeds resume/refresh from where you left off. Overall, well, bang for the bucks!\\n\",\n",

The notch is a bit of a bother but you tend to get used to it although I found Netflix and Asphalt 9 ran with a black bar eliminating the notch. I don't know if this is the case with others also.
